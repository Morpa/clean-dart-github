# Clean Dart Github

This project is a proof of concept to test the [Flutterando](https://github.com/Flutterando) Clean architecture proposal  ([Clean-Dart](https://github.com/Flutterando/Clean-Dart)) with different state managers handling data provided by the API of the Github using Flutter 3.

Overrall, the architecture of the software must follow clear contexts of maintainability and scalability, that being said, it is extremely important to evaluate the architectural structure of the product even before the development, to result in a more versatile application whereupon it improves the ability of the developers to improve or fixing features in a short time.

# üìÅ Layers and Structs
Following the Clean Dart principles, we must separate our project into 4 layers: 
1. `Presenter`
2. `Domain` 
3. `Infrastructure` 
4. `External`
 
Highlighting that the `Presenter` layer is responsible for allocating _pages_, _widgets_ and _state management_ , it becomes understandable to group `Domain`, `Infra`, `External` layers and their respective _unit tests_ in a single project being exported as a dependency, so we can have multiple separate repositories with different state management approaches  using the same business logic and components.

Still with a top-down view, it's possible to notice that as the components and assets (fonts, images) of each project will be the same, so we can allocate the widgets in `github_commons` as well.

# üöÄ Github data
The project works with the Github API through the requests:
1. `GET` => https://api.github.com/users/{username}
2. `GET` => https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos

These 2 requests will be called in `Datasources (External Layer)` receiving data in Json format, being processed in the `Repository (Infra Layer)` now with Model format and converted to Entity format.

As we already have the data available in entities, to allocate them to be worked in `Usecases (Domain Layer)`, therefore, 3 usecases were created:
1. `GetProfile` - get data from the first request flow
2. `GetRepositories` - get data from the second request flow
3. `GetLaguages` - creates statistics with the programming languages used in repositories, by parameter it receives the repositories list fetched in usecase `GetRepositories`

These usecases are called in all projects in which they have their data handled differently and uniquely by each state manager

- Flutter has many other state managers available with different approaches ([State Management Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt) | [List of state management approaches](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options))
